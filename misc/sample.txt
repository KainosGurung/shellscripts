The song was initially composed as an anthem for the popular unity government, reflecting the spirit behind the mass mobilization of working-class people who in 1970 had elected Salvador Allende for the socialist transformation of Chile.

During Allende's campaign El pueblo unido jamás será vencido was a frequent slogan.[3][4]

The song was interpreted and recorded by a number of music groups shortly after it was composed and performed publicly by Sergio Ortega and Quilapayún.

New Chilean Song music ensembles such as Vientos del Pueblo, Inti-illimani among others, made successful recordings of the song that filled the airways and the backgrounds of political rallies.

After the U.S.-backed[5] September 11, 1973 Chilean coup the song became the anthem of the Chilean resistance against the Pinochet regime, both within Chile and among the community of Chilean exiles and their political allies abroad.

However, it was especially after Pinochet's September 1973 coup that the group Inti-Illimani (also from Chile) made it famous around the world.

During the course of time the song has been used in various protests around the world, most of which have no direct connection to the Chilean coup or Latin America.

The lyrics have been adapted or translated into many languages.
